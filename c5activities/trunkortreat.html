                <p id="totp1">The times are changing. The days are getting shorter. We're feeling the crisp, cool air in the morning. The days are getting spookier!
                     It's time for the ward Trunk-or-treat!

                    The Trunk-or-Treat will be at the Montana Building on Friday, October 25, from 5:30 - 8:30 pm. 
                    We will have our annual chili cook-off with corn muffins in the first part of the event. 
                    Ward members will show off their skills to make the most delicious chili! 
                    After everyone has had the chance to eat, members of the ward council and their councilors will be our judges. The more judges, the merrier! </p>
                <p id="totp2">When everyone is full of excellent meals with all the varieties of chili, there will be a Halloween Carnival. 
                    For all ages, both big and small. While the carnival is going on, you can still relax in the gym if you want to take a break. 
                    Also, those who want to take the time to set up their cars will be able to do so.

                    The final event will be the Trunk-or-Treating. It will be for the last half-hour of the night. 
                    The candy goes by quickly, and everyone is parked close together. During this time, the judges from before can judge each vehicle for a winner. 
                    After the judging, we will take down and clean, and the party will close. We hope everyone will have a great time as well becoming better friends.
                </p>
