        C5 Ward Activities
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to the C5 Ward Activities Page! As part of the C5 Ward Activities member, we want to help spread awareness for our future events this 2024 year!
         We want to give access to the C5 Ward members. <br><br>
        Also, it will help them to know what activities are coming up, what we are planning, and what items the members need to bring. 
        Plus, it will help inform members to invite their ministering families and non-members to these events.
 Having excellent outcomes for our ward activities will help strengthen the relationship between the members, ministering families, our own families, and friends. <br><br>
"Our most prized friend is Jesus Christ Himself. Is there any greater assurance than His 'I will be on your right hand and on your left, â€¦ and mine angels round about you, to bear you up' (D&C 84:88)? So often those 'angels round about' are our friends." Elder Ronald A. Rasband
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. <br><br>
"We should bear in mind that the success of a given activity cannot always be judged by its size. Rather, it must be judged by its effect on the lives of those participating."
President James E. Faust, Second Counselor in the First Presidency, "Strengthening the Inner Self," Ensign, Feb. 2003, 4.

      <h3>Ward Trunk-or-Treat</h3>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>The times are changing. The days are getting shorter. We're feeling the crisp, cool air in the morning. The days are getting spookier! It's time for the ward Trunk-or-treat!
        <br><br> The Trunk-or-Treat will be at the Montana Building on Friday, October 25, from 5:30 - 8:30 pm. 
        We will have our annual chili cook-off with corn muffins in the first part of the event. Ward members will show off their skills to make the most delicious chili! 
        After everyone has had the chance to eat, members of the ward council and their councilors will be our judges. The more judges, the merrier!
        <br><br>
        When everyone is full of excellent meals with all the varieties of chili, there will be a Halloween Carnival. For all ages, both big and small.
         While the carnival is going on, you can still relax in the gym if you want to take a break. Also, those who want to take the time to set up their cars will be able to do so. <br><br>
        The final event will be the Trunk-or-Treating. It will be for the last half-hour of the night. The candy goes by quickly, and everyone is parked close together. During this time, the judges from before can judge each vehicle for a winner. 
        After the judging, we will take down and clean, and the party will close. We hope everyone will have a great time as well becoming better friends.<br><br>

      <h3>C5 Ward Christmas Party</h3>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the best time of the year! When everyone remembers more about the Savior and His birth, it's a perfect time for the ward to unite to fellowship and remember more about Thee.<br><br>
         This ward Christmas party is an ideal time for ministering and being a light to the world. We will be in the little town of Bethlehem for this year's Christmas party. 
         We will have our dinner there and enjoy everyone's company. Also, you will see the Nativity Scene and a skit on the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. <br><br>
         We want to end this year on a high note. However, we want everyone to understand more about the Savior and how much He means in His Gospel for you and me.
