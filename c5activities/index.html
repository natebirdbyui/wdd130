                <p id="homepagep1"> Welcome to the C5 Ward Activities Page! As part of the C5 Ward Activities member,
                     we want to help spread awareness for our future events this 2024 year! We want to give access to the C5 Ward members.

                    Also, it will help them to know what activities are coming up, what we are planning, and what items the members need to bring. 
                    Plus, it will help inform members to invite their ministering families and non-members to these events. 
                    Having excellent outcomes for our ward activities will help strengthen the relationship between the members, 
                    ministering families, our own families, and friends.</p>
                <p id="homepagep2">"Our most prized friend is Jesus Christ Himself.
                     Is there any greater assurance than His 'I will be on your right hand and on your left, â€¦ and mine angels round about you, to bear you up' (D&C 84:88)? 
                     So often those 'angels round about' are our friends." Elder Ronald A. Rasband Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

                    "We should bear in mind that the success of a given activity cannot always be judged by its size. 
                    Rather, it must be judged by its effect on the lives of those participating." 
                    President James E. Faust, Second Counselor in the First Presidency, "Strengthening the Inner Self," Ensign, Feb. 2003, 4.</p>
