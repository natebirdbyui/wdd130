                    It's the best time of the year! When everyone remembers more about the Savior and His birth, 
                    it's a perfect time for the ward to unite to fellowship and remember more about Thee.

                    This ward Christmas party is an ideal time for ministering and being a light to the world.
                    We will have our dinner there and enjoy everyone's company. A 1st annual Dessert Bake-off! With an Ugly Sweater Contest. 
                    Trophies will be award for for dessert and ugly sweater winners!
                    There will be an Entertainment Extravaganza from the ward auxiliaries. Also, table games to keep everyone entertained.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our dinner menu will be the following: Ham, Baked Potato, Green beans, and Roll. Water and Strawberry Lemonade as beverage.
                    More desserts the merrier!
                    <br><br>
                    For a large scale menu and limited kitchen resource, we will need your help! The food will be purchased.

                    President Jeffrey R. Holland, Acting President<br>

“I submit that unless we see all the meaning and joy of Christmas the way old Simeon saw it all — the whole of Christ’s life, 
the profound mission, the end as well as the beginning — then Christmas will be just another day off work with food and fun and football, 
and a measure of personal loneliness and family sorrow for some. The true meaning, the unique,
joyous meaning of the birth of this baby was not confined to those first hours in Bethlehem but would be realized in the life He would lead and in His death, 
in His triumphant atoning sacrifice and in His prison-bursting Resurrection. These are the realities that make Christmas joyful” 
(Pembroke College Chapel at the University of Oxford, Nov. 25, 2018). <br><br>
                    We want to end this year on a high note. However, we want everyone to understand more about the Savior and how much He means in His Gospel for you and me.
