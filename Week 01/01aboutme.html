    <h2>Nathan</h2>
    
    <p>Hello! My name is Nathan. I also go by Nate.
        I am a part-time student. I just completed my first semester under BYU-I. I completed BYU Pathway last year and contining forth this year.
    Last semester I completed my Intro to Programming class. I am still on the learing stages as a green-horn. I know that it will take a lot of time to complete.</p> 
    <p> I am working on my Software Development degree. I work for the State of Idaho, in the Deparment of Correction. I am a Correctional Specialist and specialize in the kitchen.
        I do say that I just gotten out of prison. It was a funny ice breaker when I first attended church when I was able to due to my schedule. My hair was short, it was on a fast-Sunday.
      It was the same day I did my second son's baby blessing. I told the ward that I have been in the ward for about a year. The reason no one has seen me, because I have been
    in and out of prison. The reaction from the congregation was priceless. After, I told them I have a difficult schedule due to being an officer there. There was a lot of sighs of relief.
    After nine years of prison, I would like to have a different career with less stress and a better atmosphere. 
     </p>
    <p>Anywho, I am married to my best friend almost eleven years now. We have six kids. All from ages almost ten, almost eight, six, four, two, and fifteen months. 
        You can say that I am always on my toes with them. It is a real blessing to have my family in my life. 
    </p>
    <p>I am taking this course to apply to my require classes. I can use this class and knowledge for a future career.
    </p>
